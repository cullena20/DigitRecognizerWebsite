# Digit Recognizer Website

Use this website to draw digits and to have different ML models predict what they are. Currently, you can test a one-hidden layer neural
network, a convolutional neural network, and a neural network I wrote from scratch in Numpy with the guidance of Michael Nielsen's [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/). I built and trained these neural networks in TensorFlow. Digits are pre-processed before being run through models to improve accuracy.
