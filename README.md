# Digit Recognizer Website

Use this website to draw digits and to have different ML models predict what they are. Currently, you can test a one hidden layer neural
network and a convolutional neural network. I built and trained these neural networks in TensorFlow. Digits are additionally processed
before being run through models to improve accuracy.
